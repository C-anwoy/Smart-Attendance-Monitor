# Smart-Attendance-Monitor

## A Django Website

### Brief Description:

• This is a geo-location based attendance registering website secured by face recognition.

• While a class is going on, the website accesses the location of the teacher and that of the students who are supposed to be in the class.

• If the locations are well within a specified range then the face of the student is scanned.

• The scanned image is sent to the server and matched against the image of the student stored in the database. If the images match only then the student is marked present in the class.

• The teacher as well as each student must have either their smart phones or laptops with them.
